      <h1>Section 1</h1>
        <div>
          <p>This is the beginning of my site for the NanoDegree class. The first thing I learned was how to use tags in order to make words <b>bold</b> or <em>italicized.</em></p>
          <p><span class="link">This image is also a link to ESPN.COM, which I visit frequently:<br><a href = "http://www.espn.com" target=_blank><img src="images/espn01.jpg" alt="Sorry!"></a></span></p> 
          <p>I also learned the difference between <b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b> elements.</p>
          <p>Examples of inline tags are the break* tag, the form tag and the span tag.</p>
          <p>Examples of block tags, <em>which are intended to make a box of text</em>, are the paragraph tag, the strong tag and the div tag.
          </p>
           <p class="note">*<b>Note:</b> <em>Need to research how to put the actual tags into plain text so that the computer doesn't interpret as code.</em></p>
        </div><br>
      <h1>Section 2</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Websites are structured using a 'tree' with matching elements that get lined up using "tags" in a computer language called HTML.</p>
          <p>The computer then interprets the HTML in order to identify how the page should look using style sheets (CSS).</p>
          <p>Most browsers have developer tools that allow you to see the source code as well as the style sheets, which is helpful for learning how to code a site.</p>
          <p>Basically everything on a website is just a series of boxes made to look like other things, even <b class="green">circles.</b></p>
          <p>Websites can also be thought of as one big grid with many boxes within them.</p>         
        </div><br>
      <h1>Section 3</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be added to your code as a linked file <b>or</b> at the top of the HTML document <b>or</b> within the tag itself (very repetitive, not recommended).</p>
          <p>Not repeating yourself is important because it will save time and ensure that site formatting and appearance is consistent throughout.</p>
          <p>"Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect. That idea is known as inheritance and understanding it requires abstract thinking.</p>
          <p> As mentioned above, HTML elements are placed into boxes and each box has 4 main components, but can also have many sub-components. Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.</p>
          <p>Adding the rule "display: flex;" to the appropriate CSS will let 'DIVs' appear next to each other instead of taking up the whole page.</p>
